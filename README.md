# GitHub Block

This repository contains views, explores, and dashboards that make up the GitHub Commmits Block.
GitHub Commits dahboard provides an analysis of commit history, commit authors and repository changes.

LookML content of this block is remotely included through the GitHub Commits Config project and is installed through the Marketplace.

The LookML constants are used to specify the name of the schema and connection. They are defined in the GitHub Commits Config project.

This Block is modeled on the schema brough in by Fivetran's [GitHub connector](https://fivetran.com/directory/github). It will bring over all the tables that are available in the [GitHub Schema](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lx6ez7-x-s-n2JCnCi3SjG4XMmx9ysNUvaNCaWc3I_I/edit#slide=id.g244d368397_0_1).
